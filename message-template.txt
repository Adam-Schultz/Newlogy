Hey there! I'm Erik, a senior at GM.

You might have noticed that Schoology had an update a week or so ago, which some people found annoying (at least in my History class). I was way too exhausted after school let out on Tuesday to do actual schoolwork, so I decided to program a Chrome extension people can install to make the interface easier to use and a little nicer, aesthetically speaking.

I talked to the senior SCA representatives, and they were able to post some quick information on our class page about the extension (which is called Newlogy and which you can look at here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/newlogy/bjcabjilfhmoahlpkffkla... ). People in my grade seemed to really like the idea and found it really useful; it now has almost 150 users around the school. I was wondering if perhaps one of you, as SCA members, might be willing to post something similar on the Freshman class page? You can copy and paste from the senior post here if you like: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tckyXqoBvJtIhce46US5DFVt0mjP3VgADT4G8X0lysY

Since this isn't really that important (and is only tangentially related to school), feel free to ignore this. I just thought some people might appreciate being able to go back to something similar the old version of Schoology (with some enhancements), since I heard a lot of people complaining.

Thanks for reading!
Erik
